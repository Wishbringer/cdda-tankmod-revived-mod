# cdda-tankmod-revived-mod

The official replacement to my old Tanks And Other Vehicles mod, for Catacylsm DDA. Formerly dependant upon Vehicle Additions Pack, formerly an in-repo mod and now being maintained as a third-party mod with no need for dependency upon other mods.

Notable changes from the last in-repo version of Tankmod:
1. The main battle tank, self-propelled howitzer, and infantry fighting vehicle have been overhauled, more closely modeled after their real-world counterparts (which they've now been named after). Gone are the odd, spacious Merkava-like layouts, in favor of designs that better mimic the M1 Abrams, M109 howitzer, and M2 Bradley.
2. The light tank, mobile gun system, and atomic mini-tank have been removed for now. One was based off a design that hasn't been in active service for ages and would have a wildly different armament, the second will need some serious overhauling and a different ammotype, while the third was intentionally fictional but will need reworking due to minireactors being obsolete. I have plans to re-add them, however!
3. Weapons and ammunition have been rebalanced heavily. Damage and explosive force more closely matches available information concerning the tank, artillery, and autocannon ammunition they're based off of. Handloads in particular are more resource-intensive but have the shot of raw impact that makes them worth it, and undesired ammunition can be taken apart for the relevant resources.
4. 30mm autocannon and ammunition have been swapped out for 25mm, as the IFV's real-world influence uses a different model of autocannon. 30mm might return separately for a different vehicle and/or helicopter use, but more likely future updates will see increased use of 25mm.
5. Since tank drones are not only obsolete in vanilla, shifted to Aftershock, but also lack 120mm cannons, this mod no longer touches tankbots. But, I have tankbot-related plans of me own for the future.
6. Rebalanced and updated vehicle groups. Tanks and such should generally only spawn in vehicle groups where other military vehicles can be found, and generally are more sensible weights.

Planned future features:
1. Reimplementing the light tank, most likely to be based off the M551 Sheridan and thus will likely use 152mm TOW instead of a tank cannon. These will likely be confined to specific locational spawns, being an obsolete Gulf War era tank that might plausibly be brought out of reserve for emergency use.
2. Possibly the introduction of 105mm as a step step from 120mm. If I do, this will lead to adding 105mm howitzers, the M60 Patton tank (use sparingly for the same reason as above, being an obsolete tank in reserve storage, but WAY more common than Sheridans), and potentially a revival of the mobile gun system as the 105mm Stryker variant.
3. A 155mm towed howitzer might show up as well, likely in dedicated spawn locations implying hastily set up positions, the same use case that 105mm howitzers will see.
4. Naval and aircraft use of 25mm. Patrol boats might become a rare spawn at docks, some crashed aircraft might have the 25mm autocannon, etc.
5. A rework of the fictional atomic mini-tank into a more viable solar-electric design.
6. A revival of tank drones as a legit automated tankette, likely to be a rare encounter specific to certain areas.
7. Other encounters of armored vehicles in expected places.
